AayuScans is a React Native mobile application designed to scan and identify medicinal plants. By leveraging React Native and Firebase, this app provides an intuitive interface for users to explore and learn about various medicinal plants.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aayuscans.git
cd aayuscans
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
Step 1: Start the Metro Server
Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your project:

bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start your Application
While Metro Bundler runs in its own terminal, open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project and run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
bash
Copy code
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, your new app should be running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly.

Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that your app is up and running, let's make some changes:

Open App.tsx in your text editor and modify some lines.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.
